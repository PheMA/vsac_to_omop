This is really old code in unknown state.  

It used to use CTS2 services to access VSAC and retrieve a value set based on an oid set in the configuration file.
The codes in the value set would then be compared to an existing OMOP repository to be sure they are all present
OMOP concept sets would then be created for each of the value sets.
